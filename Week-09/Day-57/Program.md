# Day 57 - 26 August 2025 

## 📌 What I Learned Today
- Explored more concepts in **Node.js**  
- Understood deeper functionality of Node.js modules  
- Learned about handling asynchronous operations effectively  
- Studied usage of built-in modules (`fs`, `path`, `http`)  
- Gained clarity on event-driven architecture in Node.js  

## 🚀 Key Takeaways
- Node.js follows a **non-blocking, event-driven architecture** making it efficient for I/O-heavy applications  
- Asynchronous programming is essential to avoid blocking the main thread  
- Built-in modules are very powerful and can handle most low-level tasks easily  

## ⏱ Time Spent
- **3 hours** (learning + coding practice)  

## 💡 Motivation
*"Consistency beats intensity — each day’s effort adds up to the developer you’re becoming!"*
