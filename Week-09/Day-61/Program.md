# Day 61 - 30 August 2025

## Topics Revised
- **Arrays (Hard Problems)**
  - Practiced sliding window techniques on complex problems.
  - Revised prefix sum and hashing-based approaches for optimization.
  - Solved problems on subarrays with specific conditions (sum, length, etc.).

- **Strings (Hard Problems)**
  - Worked on advanced string manipulation and pattern-matching problems.
  - Revised concepts like KMP algorithm, Z-function, and Rabin-Karp for efficient substring search.
  - Solved problems related to palindrome partitioning, longest repeating subsequences, and string transformations.

## Time Spent
- 3 hours

## Key Takeaways
- Importance of using optimal algorithms like KMP instead of brute force for pattern matching.
- Reinforced understanding of sliding window and two-pointer approaches.
- Learned new tricks for handling edge cases in string manipulations.

## Motivation
â€œHard problems are not barriers, they are stepping stones".
