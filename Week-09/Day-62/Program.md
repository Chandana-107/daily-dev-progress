# Day 62 - 31st August 2025

## 📝 What I Practiced
- Practiced problems that required:
  - Traversing linked lists
  - Handling edge cases (empty list, single node, cycles)
  - Optimizing space and time complexity
- Strengthened understanding of pointers and references in linked lists

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Learned to break down medium problems into smaller sub-problems
- Improved confidence in solving linked list variations
- Understood how careful pointer manipulation is crucial for correctness

## ⏳ Time Spent
- 2 hours

## 💡 Motivation
_"Consistency is more powerful than intensity".
