# Day 46 - 15 August 2025

## üß† What I Learned:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Search (Basics ‚Üí Advanced)
- **Basic Idea**: Efficiently searching a sorted collection by halving the search range each time.
- **Iterative & Recursive** implementations.
- Avoiding integer overflow in mid calculation:  
  `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`
- Binary search variations:
  - First & last occurrence search.
  - Binary search on descending arrays.
- **Advanced Applications**:
  - Binary search on the answer space (e.g., Aggressive Cows, Minimum Days to Ship Packages).
  - Lower Bound & Upper Bound problems.
  - Monotonic function-based binary search.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Node.js (Few Topics)
- **Event Loop**:
  - Handles asynchronous tasks without blocking execution.
  - Uses a queue system for callbacks.
- **Modules**:
  - CommonJS (`require`) vs ES Modules (`import`/`export`).
- **File System (`fs` Module)**:
  - Reading files (`fs.readFile`)
  - Writing files (`fs.writeFile`)
- **npm Basics**:
  - Initializing a project with `npm init`.
  - Installing dependencies locally & globally

## üí° Key Takeaways:
- Binary Search is powerful for problems with sorted data or monotonic conditions.
- Variations of binary search appear frequently in competitive programming.
- Node.js is built for efficiency and works seamlessly with asynchronous tasks.
- Knowing both DSA and backend basics helps in becoming a full-stack developer.

## ‚è≥ Time Spent:
- Binary Search: **3 hrs**
- Node.js Topics & Practice: **1 hr**

## üî• Motivation:
*"Every efficient algorithm and every new backend concept is a tool sharpening my developer‚Äôs edge."*
