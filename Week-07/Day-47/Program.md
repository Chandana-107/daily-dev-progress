# Day 47 - 16 August 2025

## üß† What I Learned:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Searching (Revision)
- Reviewed linear search, binary search, and variations.
- Understood edge cases in binary search like infinite loops, mid calculation, and boundary conditions.
- Reinforced importance of binary search on **monotonic functions**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sorting (Revision)
- Revised common sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick.
- Compared time complexities and use cases.
- Understood stability in sorting algorithms.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Search (Hard Problems)
- Solved 2 advanced problems that required careful handling of conditions.
- Learned how binary search can be applied beyond just arrays, such as in **search space problems**.
- Improved debugging skills for off-by-one errors.

## üß† Key Learnings:
- Binary Search is not limited to arrays, it can also be applied to **search space problems** (like minimizing/maximizing answers).
- Importance of carefully handling **low, high, and mid** pointers to avoid infinite loops.
- Sorting algorithms are the backbone for many problems; choosing the right one depends on **time complexity, stability, and constraints**.
- Debugging binary search becomes easier with **dry runs** and boundary checks.
- Hard problems test logical thinking more than syntax ‚Äî patience is key.

## Time Spent:
3.5 hours  
(1 hr: Searching revision, 1 hr: Sorting revision, 1.5 hrs: Solving Binary Search hard problems)

## üí° Motivation of the Day:
*"Every hard problem you solve today becomes an easy problem tomorrow. Stay consistent, because small daily progress leads to big achievements."*
