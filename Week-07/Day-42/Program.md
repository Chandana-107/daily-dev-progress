# Day 42 - August 11, 2025


## 🧠 What I Learned:

### 🔍 Searching (Revision)
- **Linear Search**:
  - Sequentially checks each element in the list until the target is found.
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Best case: Element found at first position.
  - Worst case: Element not found or at last position.

- **Binary Search**:
  - Works only on sorted arrays.
  - Repeatedly divides the search interval in half to locate the target.
  - Time Complexity: O(log n)
  - Requires random access (e.g., arrays, not linked lists).

### Linked List (Easy Problems)
- **Traversal**:
  - Visiting each node in sequence from `head` to `NULL`.
- **Insertion**:
  - At the beginning: O(1) — just adjust the head pointer.
  - At the end: O(n) — requires traversal to last node.
- **Searching in Linked List**:
  - Similar to Linear Search (O(n)), but requires pointer navigation.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Searching algorithms are fundamental for data lookup operations.
- Linked Lists require sequential access, making binary search impractical without modification.
- Pointer handling is critical in linked list operations to avoid memory errors.
