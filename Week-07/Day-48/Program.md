# Day 48 - 17 August 2025


## üß† What I Learned:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Stacks (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
- Understood stack operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `isEmpty`.
- Learned how stacks are used in problems like **reversing strings, balancing parentheses, and undo operations**.
- Explored how stack can be implemented using arrays and linked lists.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Queues (FIFO - First In, First Out)
- Understood queue operations: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `front`, and `rear`.
- Learned how queues are used in problems like **task scheduling, order processing, and BFS traversal**.
- Explored implementation using arrays, linked lists, and circular queues.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Problem-Solving
- Solved a few easy problems to apply stack and queue concepts.
- Practiced scenarios like reversing data, checking valid parentheses, and simulating queues.
---

## üí° Key Takeaways:
- Stacks and Queues are **fundamental data structures** forming the base for advanced topics like graphs, trees, and system design.
- Practicing problems made the concepts **more intuitive and less theoretical**.
- Learned the **real-world applications** of both structures which improved my understanding.


## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Spent:
- **3 hours** (1.5 hrs on concepts + 1.5 hrs on problem-solving)

## üî• Motivation:
"Every data structure mastered is a new tool in your problem-solving arsenal. Today I added **Stacks & Queues** to my toolkit ."
