# Day 44 - 13 August 2025

## 🧠 What I Learned:

### 1️⃣ Introduction to SQL
- SQL stands for **Structured Query Language** and is used to interact with relational databases.
- Works with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle.
- Helps in creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD operations).

### 2️⃣ SQL Core Concepts
- **Database** → Collection of organized data.
- **Table** → Data stored in rows and columns.
- **Row (Record)** → A single entry of data in a table.
- **Column (Field)** → Specific attribute or property of the data.
- **Primary Key** → Unique identifier for each row.
- **Foreign Key** → Creates a relationship between two tables.

### 3️⃣ Basic SQL Commands
- `CREATE DATABASE db_name;` → Creates a database.
- `CREATE TABLE table_name (...);` → Creates a table with defined columns.
- `INSERT INTO table_name (...) VALUES (...);` → Inserts new records.
- `SELECT * FROM table_name;` → Retrieves all records from a table.
- `UPDATE table_name SET column=value WHERE condition;` → Updates existing data.
- `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;` → Deletes specific data.

## 💡 Key Takeaways:
- SQL is the foundation of working with relational data.
- Knowing how to filter (`WHERE`), sort (`ORDER BY`), and limit results makes queries efficient.
- Primary and foreign keys are essential for maintaining data integrity.

## Time Spent:
4.5 hrs

## 🔥 Motivation:
*"Databases are like treasure chests — SQL is the key that opens them."*
