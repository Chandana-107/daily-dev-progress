# Day 64 - 2 September 2025

## 📘 What I Learned Today  
- Revised the **basics of Express.js**.  
- Went through the core concepts like:  
  - Setting up a basic Express server.  
  - Understanding routes (`app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc.).  
  - Middleware and its flow in request handling.  
  - Serving static files.  
  - Handling request and response objects.  

## 🔑 Key Takeaways  
- Express.js makes backend development faster and more organized compared to plain Node.js.  
- Middleware is powerful for handling tasks like logging, authentication, and error handling.  
- Routing structure helps in keeping the code modular and clean.
