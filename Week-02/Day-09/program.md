# 🚀 Day 09 - July 9, 2025

## ✅ What I Did

* ✅ Revised easy + medium level **Array problems** on LeetCode

  * Covered patterns: **sliding window**, **two pointers**, **prefix sum**
* ✅ Revisited core **JavaScript concepts** required for React:

  * `var`, `let`, `const`
  * Arrow functions, template literals
  * Array methods: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
  * Callback functions, scope, hoisting

## ⏱️ Time Spent

> `4.5 hours` 

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* DSA: Arrays become easy with practice & right patterns
* JS: React requires a **strong JS base**, especially array manipulation and ES6 features
* Understanding fundamentals now will save headaches later in React

## 🔥 Motivation

> “Grind in silence. Let the code, confidence & consistency make the noise. 💻🔥”
