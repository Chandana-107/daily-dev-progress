# Day 74 -12 September 2025  

**Today’s Progress:**  
I learnt the basics of **Binary Search Trees (BST)**.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- BST is a binary tree where the left child contains values smaller than the root, and the right child contains values greater than the root.  
- Inorder traversal of a BST gives elements in sorted order.  
- Common operations: insertion, deletion, searching.  
- BST helps in efficient searching and sorting with average time complexity O(log n).  

**Time Spent:**  
2 hours  

**Motivation:**  
Step by step, I’m getting better at DSA.
