# Day 77 - 15 September 2025

**Today’s Progress:**  
I learnt the basics of **Graphs**.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- A graph is a collection of **nodes (vertices)** connected by **edges**.  
- Graphs can be **directed** (edges have direction) or **undirected** (edges don’t have direction).  
- Graphs can also be **weighted** (edges have a cost/weight) or **unweighted**.  
- Common ways to represent graphs:  
  - **Adjacency Matrix** (2D array)  
  - **Adjacency List** (map/list of neighbors)  
- Graphs are widely used in networks, maps, and social media connections.  

**Time Spent:**  
 2 hour (understanding graph theory basics and representations).  

**Motivation of the Day:**  
“Just like graphs connect nodes, every small concept you learn connects you closer to your dream job — keep building those connections!”
