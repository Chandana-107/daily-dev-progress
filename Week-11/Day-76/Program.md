# Day 76 - 14 September 2025

**Today’s Progress:**  
I solved the **deletion operation in Binary Search Tree (BST)**.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Deletion in BST has **3 main cases**:  
  1. **Node with no children (leaf node):** Remove the node directly.  
  2. **Node with one child:** Replace the node with its child.  
  3. **Node with two children:** Replace the node with its **inorder successor** (minimum value in the right subtree) or **inorder predecessor** (maximum value in the left subtree), then delete that node.  

**Time Spent:**
1.5 hours (understanding theory + implementing and testing the code).

**Motivation** 
 “Step by step, you’re mastering even the toughest problems. Just like in BST deletion, life may give you tricky cases — but with the right strategy, you can always handle them.”
