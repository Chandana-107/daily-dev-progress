# 🚀 Day 03 - July 3, 2025

## ✅ What I Did
- Light revision & concept day — kept the streak alive 💪
- DSA: Reviewed array problems and edge cases
  - Prefix Sum
  - Two Pointer Technique
  - Kadane’s Algorithm basics
- JavaScript: Brushed up on core concepts:
  - Closures
  - Callback Queue & Event Loop
  - setTimeout behavior
  - Execution Context & Call Stack
  - Hoisting
  - Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Prefix Sum reduces time complexity for range-sum queries
- Two Pointer method is optimal for sorted array operations
- Closures persist even after outer function returns
- Execution context is created in 2 phases: creation & execution
- setTimeout doesn’t run *exactly* after X ms due to event queue
- Temporal Dead Zone happens with `let` and `const` before initialization

## ⏱️ Time Spent
> 2.5 hours (focused concept revision)

## 🔥 Motivation
> "Be proud of every small win. Tiny steps forward still move you ahead."
