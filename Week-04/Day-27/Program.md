# 💻 Day 27 - 27 July 2025

## ✅ Today's Progress

### 🔸 DSA
- Practiced the **Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm**.
- Understood and implemented:
  - `Kadane's Algorithm` (revision)
  - `Majority Element` using Boyer-Moore approach
  - `Binary Search` time and space complexity
  - Difference between **iterative** and **recursive** binary search

### 🔸 Theory
- Revised key topics from:
  - **DBMS**: Transactions, Normalization
  - **React**: `props`, `useState`, and functional components

---

## 📘 Key Learnings

- **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm** efficiently finds the majority element with `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space.
- Iterative binary search uses a loop, takes less memory than recursive.
- React `props` are used to pass data; `useState` enables state management in function components.
