# 🚀 Day 23 - 23 July 2025

### ✅ What I learned:

* Learned about **Props Handling in React**:
  * `defaultProps` – Setting fallback values for props.
  * `PropTypes` – Validating prop types for reliability.
  * **Destructuring Props** – Cleaner code with direct access to values.
  * `children` Prop – Rendering nested components dynamically.
  * `isRequired` – Enforcing necessary props.
* Explored **State in React** – Managing component-level data using `useState()`.
* Practiced basic **App Building** with props and state integration.

### ⏰ Time Spent:

* Total: ~3.5 hours
  * 1.5 hr on props and PropTypes
  * 2 hrs on state and app practice

---

### 💡 Motivation:

> *"Mastering props and state means you’re no longer guessing how React works — you're **controlling** how your app behaves."*
