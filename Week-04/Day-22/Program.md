# Day 22 - 22 July 2025

### ✅ Tasks Completed:
- Explored **NPM (Node Package Manager)** and how it manages project dependencies.
- Learned about **Module Bundlers**:
  - 📦 Parcel – Zero configuration, beginner-friendly.
  - ⚡ Vite – Super fast, ideal for modern React development.
- Understood the purpose and structure of the **`node_modules/`** directory.
- Studied the default **React App File Structure**:
  - `public/` – Static assets like `index.html`.
  - `src/` – React components and logic.
  - `index.js` – Entry point; renders the app.
  - `App.js` – Root component of the app.

### 🔑 Key Takeaways 
   - **Parcel:** Zero-config, beginner-friendly bundler with auto hot-reloading.  
   - **Vite:** Ultra-fast modern bundler using ES Modules; great for React apps.
   - NPM installs and manages packages. All dependencies are stored in the `node_modules/` folder, which should be ignored in Git.
   
### ⏰ Time Spent:
- Total: 2.5 hours  
  - 1 hr on npm and bundlers  
  - 1.5 hrs on React app structure
