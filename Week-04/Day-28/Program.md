# 💻 Day 28 - 28 July 2025

---

## ✅ Today's Progress

### 🔸 React.js
- Deep dived into advanced React Hooks:
  - `useReducer`: For managing complex state transitions
  - `useMemo`: For optimizing expensive calculations
- Practiced and implemented:
  - Real-world analogies for better understanding
  - Multiple examples based on `useReducer` & `useMemo`

### 🔸 DSA
- Practiced:
  - **Kadane’s Algorithm** (max subarray sum)
  - **Majority Element** using Boyer-Moore
  - **Find Duplicates** using hashing technique (index marking)

### 🔸 Revision
- React Hooks:
  - `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useRef` (quick brush-up)

## 📘 Key Learnings

- **useReducer** is ideal when state updates are complex or based on previous state values.
- **useMemo** improves performance by memoizing heavy calculations and recalculating only when dependencies change.
- Practicing React with real-world examples helps solidify concepts and makes interview prep easier.
- Continued DSA focus is building problem-solving confidence.
