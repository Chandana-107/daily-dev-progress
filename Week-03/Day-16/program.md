### **Day 16 - July 16, 2025**

##  What I Did Today

*  Completed **2 Assessments** (15 MCQs + 6 Coding Qs each)
*  Learned **Operating System Basics** 

  * Process vs Thread
  * CPU Scheduling Intro
  * Types of OS
*  Practiced Leetcode: `containsDuplicate` using `unordered_set`
*  Revised HTML/CSS/JS concepts from the assessments

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* OS: Threads are lightweight processes; scheduling affects performance
* HTML: Use `<nav>` for navigation
* CSS: `position: static` is default; `display: flex` creates flex container
* JS: Use `unordered_set` to find duplicates efficiently
