# 🚀 Day 04 - July 4, 2025

## ✅ What I Did

* Kept the momentum strong 💪 — focused on new patterns & deeper concepts

* **DSA**: Solved pattern-based array problems

  * Sliding Window – Fixed & Variable Window

    * Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
    * First Negative Number in Every Window of Size K
    * Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  * Kadane’s Advanced

    * Maximum Product Subarray
    * Max Sum Circular Subarray

* **JavaScript**: Explored advanced ES6 topics

  * Arrow Functions & lexical `this`
  * `this` keyword in different contexts (global, function, object, arrow)
  * `call()`, `apply()`, `bind()` – use cases & behavior
  * Destructuring (arrays & objects)
  * Spread & Rest Operators

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Sliding Window reduces nested loops in subarray problems
* Arrow functions do not bind their own `this`
* `call`, `apply`, and `bind` help control `this` manually
* Destructuring simplifies object/array access
* Spread is for expansion, Rest is for grouping

## ⏱️ Time Spent
