**Todayâ€™s Progress:**  
I learnt more about the **basics of Dynamic Programming (DP)** and also solved **2 problems** to strengthen my understanding.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Reinforced the foundation of DP concepts like overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.  
- Gained practical exposure by solving problems and applying DP logic.  
- Felt more confident in identifying when DP can be used.  

**Time Spent:**  
2.5 hours (learning + problem solving).  

**Motivation:**  
Every problem I solve with DP takes me one step closer to mastering advanced problem-solving skills. ðŸš€
