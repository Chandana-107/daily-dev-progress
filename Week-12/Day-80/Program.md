# Day 80 - 18 September 2025

**Today’s Progress:**  
I revised the **basics of Graphs**.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Graphs consist of **vertices (nodes)** and **edges (connections)**.  
- Types of graphs: directed, undirected, weighted, unweighted.  
- Representations: **Adjacency Matrix** and **Adjacency List**.  
- Common graph traversal techniques: **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** and **DFS (Depth-First Search)**.  
- Graphs are widely used in real-world problems like social networks, maps, and recommendation systems.  

**Time Spent:**  
1.5 hour (revision + practice).  

**Motivation of the Day:**  
 “Revisiting the basics strengthens your foundation — just like strong roots help a tree stand tall, strong fundamentals help you solve complex problems with confidence.”
