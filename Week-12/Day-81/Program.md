# Day 81 - 19 September 2025

**Today’s Progress:**  
I learnt about the basics of **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- DP is an optimization technique used to solve problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.  
- It is mainly used when problems have **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure**.  
- Two common approaches:  
  - **Top-Down (Memoization):** Solving recursively and storing results.  
  - **Bottom-Up (Tabulation):** Solving iteratively using a DP table.  
- DP helps reduce time complexity compared to plain recursion.  
- Common examples: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence.  

**Time Spent:**  
1.5 hours (reading theory + practicing simple problems).  

**Motivation of the Day:**  
“Dynamic Programming teaches us that saving past efforts helps us solve bigger challenges ahead — just like in life.”
