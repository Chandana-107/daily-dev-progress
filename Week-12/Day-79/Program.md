# Day 79 - 17 September 2025

**Today’s Progress:**  
I solved some **easy/basic level problems in Graphs** to strengthen my understanding of graph fundamentals.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Practiced simple traversal-based problems.  
- Revised the difference between adjacency list and adjacency matrix representation.  
- Gained confidence in applying BFS and DFS logic to smaller problems.  

**Time Spent:**  
2 hour (solving easy graph problems and revising basics).  

**Motivation of the Day:**  
 “Every solved problem is a step forward — even the simplest graphs lead to stronger foundations.”
