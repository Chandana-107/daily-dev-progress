# Day 82 - 20 September 2025

**Today’s Progress:**  
I solved a few more **Dynamic Programming (DP)** problems.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Practiced breaking problems into smaller subproblems.  
- Improved my understanding of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.  
- Gained more confidence in applying tabulation and memoization techniques.  

**Time Spent:**  
1.5 hours (solving and revising DP problems).  

**Motivation of the Day:**  
 “Every DP problem you solve builds your problem-solving muscles. Keep going — consistency is the true secret to mastery.”
