# Day 78 - 16 September 2025

**Today’s Progress:**  
I revised the **basics of graphs** and also practiced **problems on Binary Search Trees (BST)**.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Refreshed concepts of graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list).  
- Revised traversal techniques like BFS and DFS.  
- Solved problems related to BST insertion, deletion, and traversal.  
- Strengthened understanding of how graphs and BSTs are applied in problem-solving.  

**Time Spent:**  
 1.5 hours (revision + problem-solving).  

**Motivation of the Day:**  
 “Revision is not repetition, it’s reinforcement — every time you review and practice, you make your foundation unshakable.”
