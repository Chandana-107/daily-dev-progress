# Day 40 - August 9, 2025


## üß† What I Learned:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Arrays (Deep Revision)
- Refreshed concepts on array indexing, traversal, and manipulation.
- Reviewed advanced topics like sliding window, prefix sum, and subarray problems.
- Practiced optimizing array-based solutions for time complexity.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Strings (Deep Revision)
- Revisited string manipulation techniques (splitting, joining, substring extraction).
- Revised pattern matching approaches (Brute Force, KMP).
- Solved problems involving palindrome checks, anagrams, and substring search.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sorting Algorithms (Deep Revision)
- Revised Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- Focused on their **time & space complexities** and **when to use which algorithm**.
- Solved problems that combined sorting with other logic (two-pointer technique, binary search).

---

## üìù Practice Done:
- Solved a few problems on Arrays, Strings, and Sorting.
- Mixed easy and medium-level problems to strengthen problem-solving skills.

---

## üí° Key Takeaways:
- Deep revision helps uncover hidden mistakes in logic.
- Knowing when to use each sorting algorithm is crucial for optimization.
- Small practice sessions compound into big improvements over time.
