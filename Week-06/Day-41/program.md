# Day 41 - August 10, 2025

## üß† What I Learned:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Linked List Basics
- Understanding nodes and pointers
- Singly Linked List structure and traversal
- Insertion at beginning, end, and a specific position
- Deletion from beginning, end, and a specific position

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Stack Basics
- LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
- Implementation using arrays and linked lists
- Push, Pop, Peek operations
- Stack overflow and underflow conditions
---
## Time spent :
3 hrs 

## üöÄ Key Takeaways:
- Linked Lists are dynamic and efficient for frequent insertions/deletions.
- Stacks are simple but powerful for problems requiring reverse order processing.
- Hands-on coding of both helped reinforce theoretical concepts.

## Motivation 
"Every single step forward is closer to your success"
