# Day 39 - 8 August 2025

## 🧠 What I Learned:

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search**:
  - Sequentially checks each element of the list.
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Best case: Element found at first position.
  - Worst case: Element not found or at last position.

- **Binary Search**:
  - Works on sorted arrays.
  - Repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
  - Time Complexity: O(log n)
  - Efficient for large datasets.

- **Comparison**:
  - Binary search is much faster than linear search for large **sorted** datasets.
  - Linear search works on unsorted data but is slower.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Searching helps in locating elements quickly in a dataset.
- Choosing the right algorithm depends on whether data is sorted.
- Mastery of searching lays the foundation for more complex algorithms.
