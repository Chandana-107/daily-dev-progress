# 💻 Day 30 - 30 July 2025

## ✅ Today's Progress

### 🔸 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

- Completed **Arrays** in full detail:
  - Traversal
  - Insertion and Deletion
  - Searching (Linear & Binary)
  - Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)
  - Frequency Count
  - Prefix Sum Technique
  - Sliding Window Technique
  - Kadane’s Algorithm (Max Subarray Sum)
  - Next Greater and Smaller Element
  - Majority Element (Boyer-Moore Algorithm)
  - Two-pointer approach
  - Brute Force → Better → Optimal solutions
