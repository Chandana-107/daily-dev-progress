# 💻 Day 31 - 31 July 2025


## ✅ Today's Progress

### 🔸 DSA - Strings
- Solved **4 problems** related to string manipulation.
- Concepts revised and practiced:
  - String reversal using two-pointer technique
  - Palindrome check (alphanumeric + ignoring cases)
  - Prefix matching across multiple strings
  - Substring search using brute and optimized approaches

---

## 📘 Key Learnings

- **String Traversal:** Efficient use of `for` loops and iterators
- **Two-Pointer Technique:** Great for reversing strings and palindrome checks
- **Prefix Comparison:** Helped in learning how to compare characters across strings
- **Brute vs Optimized:** Understood how naive solutions can be improved using smarter logic (e.g., KMP basics)
