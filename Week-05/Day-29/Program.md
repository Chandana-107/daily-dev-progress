# 💻 Day 29 - 29 July 2025


## ✅ What I Learnt:

### 📘 **React Topics Covered:**

- 🔹 **React Architecture** – Understood how React organizes UI into components with unidirectional data flow.
- 🔹 **API Usage in React** – Learned how to fetch and handle external data using `fetch()` and `axios`.
- 🔹 **Context API** – Explored global state management using `React.createContext()` and `useContext()`.
- 🔹 **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** – Understood what CORS is, when it causes issues, and how to fix it.
- 🔹 **Conditional Rendering** – Practiced rendering components based on certain conditions using `if`, `ternary`, and `&&` operators.
- 🔹 **React Router** – Implemented client-side routing using `react-router-dom`.
- 🔹 **Dynamic Routing** – Learned how to create routes with dynamic parameters (e.g., `/user/:id`).
- 🔹 **Outlet Component** – Understood nested routing and how `Outlet` renders child components.
- 🔹 **Class-Based Components** – Explored how components were built using ES6 classes before hooks.
- 🔹 **Lifecycle Methods** – Studied methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
- 🔹 **Custom Hooks** – Created custom reusable hooks for logic abstraction.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- React's flexibility comes from its **component-based architecture** and **declarative nature**.
- **Context API** simplifies prop drilling in deeply nested components.
- **React Router** + **Outlet** enables intuitive nested routes for scalable apps.
- **Lifecycle methods** give fine-grained control in class components, while **hooks** do the same for functional ones.
- Building **custom hooks** helps maintain DRY code and improves readability.
