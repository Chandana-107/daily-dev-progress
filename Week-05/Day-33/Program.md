# 💻 Day 33 - 2 August 2025

---

## ✅ Today's Progress

### 🔹 Data Structures & Algorithms
- Practiced **medium-level string problems**
- Explored and understood the **basics of recursion**:
  - Concept of base case and recursive calls
  - Wrote simple recursive functions (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci)

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Recursion needs a well-defined base case to avoid infinite loops
- String manipulation techniques improve with more problem-solving practice
- Breaking down problems into smaller recursive steps builds intuition

## ⏳ Time Spent
**4-5 hours**

## 🔥 Motivation for Tomorrow
_"Every line of code you write today is compounding towards mastery."_
