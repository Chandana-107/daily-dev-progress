# Day 50 - 19 August 2025


## 🧠 What I Learned:

### 1️⃣ Arrays (Hard Problems)
- Strengthened problem-solving skills on advanced array patterns.
- Practiced edge cases like duplicates, negative values, and large input sizes.
- Improved logical thinking with optimized approaches (sliding window, two pointers, hashing).

### 2️⃣ Strings (Hard Problems)
- Tackled complex problems involving string manipulation and pattern matching.
- Learned how to reduce time complexity by applying hashing and efficient data structures.
- Understood the importance of handling corner cases like empty strings and overlapping substrings.

## 💡 Key Learnings:
- Hard problems often break down into smaller sub-problems when analyzed step by step.
- Optimization techniques like prefix/suffix arrays, two pointers, and hashing are crucial.
- Debugging systematically helped in understanding hidden constraints.
