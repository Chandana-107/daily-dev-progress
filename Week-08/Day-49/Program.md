# Day 49 - 18 August 2025

## üß† What I Learned:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pointers (Deep Dive)
- Understood the concept of **memory addresses** and how pointers store them.
- Explored **pointer arithmetic** (increment, decrement, difference).
- Learned about **pointer to pointer (double pointers)** and their use cases.
- Practiced working with **arrays and pointers** (relationship and differences).
- Understood **function pointers** and how they can be used for callbacks.
- Gained clarity on **dangling pointers** and how to avoid them.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Solved
- Solved questions involving:
  - Pointer arithmetic with arrays.
  - Swapping values using pointers.
  - Using pointers to modify array elements inside functions.
  - Implementing dynamic memory allocation basics.

## ‚è≥ Time Spent:
- **3.5 hours** (Concepts + Practice)
